#TODO

+ improved parser a lot
+ make parser work over newlines (with 2 spaces)
+ made basic HTML renderer

/ make structurer 
  this will also enable us to make better commandline tools (more high level) and better manipulation display of html
+ we made the inital PEG parser fully and cleanly hierarchicall
+ we also made a very basic hierarchical renderer
+ found ymacs as HTML emacs editor, but maybe http://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html which also has aprox emacs mode will be
  more usefull as it's also got other modes and more classical editing and istructions
